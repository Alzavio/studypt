# Studyportugal.pt

StudyPortugal.pt is a website with the goal of making it easier for international students to find educational programs in Portugal. 

**Why was this project created?**

This project was created after I personally had many difficulties applying for university in Portugal, and recieved a lot of conflicting information. Much of the information required, especially for Portuguese descendents, is only available in Portuguese, is often outdated, and is often written into law in Portuguese legalese which can be very difficult for those who aren't completely fluent. This is a huge barrier, especially for those who just wish to do a program in English.

This project hopes to simplify that, by not only being a search tool, but offering step-by-step guides for people in a different situations.
